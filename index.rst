Astropy workshop
================

Astropy is a community-developed core Python package for Astronomy (including
Astrophysics, Cosmology, and other related branches). The first public release
(v0.2) was done on February 23rd 2013.

The scope of the workshop is not to give a complete introduction to Python,
but instead to familiarize users with Astropy so that they can directly use it
in their work/research. The functionality is presented in such a way that
beginners in Python should be able to follow, but please ensure that you have
a functional Python distribution installed prior to the workshop.
